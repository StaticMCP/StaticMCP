Instead of running complex server applications, StaticMCP pre-generates all responses as static JSON files that can be served from any CDN or static hosting provider.\n\nThink of it as \"static site generation for AI context\" – just as modern websites are pre-built into HTML files for lightning-fast delivery, StaticMCP pre-builds all your model context into optimized JSON files.\n\n## Why StaticMCP?\n\n### 🚀 **Blazing Fast Performance**\nWith zero runtime computation, StaticMCP delivers the fastest possible response times. Every request is served instantly from pre-generated files.\n\n### 💰 **Dramatically Lower Costs**\nEliminate server infrastructure entirely. Host your entire MCP service on free or ultra-low-cost static hosting platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.\n\n### 📦 **Dead Simple Deployment**\nNo Docker containers, no server management, no complex CI/CD pipelines. Just upload files to any static host and you're live.\n\n### 🌍 **Unlimited Scalability**\nLeverage CDN edge caching for global performance. Your MCP service automatically scales to handle millions of requests without any additional infrastructure.\n\n### 🔧 **Developer Friendly**\nBuild with any language or tool you prefer. Python scripts, Bash commands, or full-fledged build systems – if it can generate JSON, it can power StaticMCP.\n\n## 🌐 Zero Infrastructure Required\n\nUse our hosted bridge at `https://bridge.staticmcp.com` - no servers to run, no containers to manage.\n\n[Get Started →](/docs/bridge#hosted-bridge-service)\n\n## Perfect For\n\n- **Personal AI Assistants**: Expose your resume, projects, and knowledge base\n- **Documentation Sites**: Make your project docs queryable by AI models\n- **Dataset APIs**: Provide searchable access to static datasets\n- **Knowledge Bases**: Serve curated information collections\n- **Portfolio Sites**: Let AI models explore your work and achievements\n\n## How It Works\n\nStaticMCP follows a simple file-based architecture inspired by static site generators:\n\n1. **Pre-Generation Phase**: Use any tool to generate static JSON files from your data sources\n2. **File Structure**: Organize files following the StaticMCP standard directory layout\n3. **Deployment**: Upload to any static hosting provider\n4. [**Bridge Server**](/docs/bridge): A lightweight proxy translates MCP requests to file paths\n\n```\nstaticmcp-site/\n  ├── mcp.json                 # Main manifest\n  ├── resources/               # Pre-built resource responses  \n  │     ├── README.md.json\n  │     └── docs.json\n  └── tools/                   # Pre-built tool responses\n        └── search/\n              ├── javascript.json\n              └── python.json\n```\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nInstead of running a database-backed server to serve your project documentation, you could:\n\n1. Run a script that crawls your docs and generates search responses\n2. Upload the resulting JSON files to a CDN\n3. Point your AI model to `https://staticmcp.com/mcp`\n4. Get instant, cached responses worldwide\n\n## Get Started\n\nReady to try StaticMCP? Here are your next steps:\n\n- **📖 Deep Dive**: Read the [RFC specification](/docs/rfc) for complete technical details\n- **📏 Build Standard**: Follow the [StaticMCP Standard](/docs/standard) for maximum compatibility\n- **🛠️ Implementation**: Check out example generators and tools\n- **💬 Community**: Join discussions about StaticMCP patterns and best practices\n\n## The Future of AI Context\n\nStaticMCP represents a fundamental shift toward treating AI context as a first-class web resource. By embracing static generation principles, we can build more resilient, performant, and cost-effective AI integrations that scale effortlessly with the modern web.\n\nWhether you're building personal AI tools or enterprise-scale context services, StaticMCP offers a path to simpler, faster, and more reliable AI model integration.\n\n---\n\n*StaticMCP builds upon the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) standard developed by Anthropic, extending it with static generation capabilities for modern web deployment.*"
