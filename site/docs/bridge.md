# Bridge

The StaticMCP Bridge is the critical component that enables standard MCP clients to seamlessly interact with static file-based context servers. Acting as a lightweight translation layer, the bridge converts real-time MCP requests into file system operations, making static pre-generated content appear as a fully dynamic MCP server.

## Hosted Bridge Service

**URL**: `https://bridge.staticmcp.com`

The easiest way to use StaticMCP is with our hosted bridge service. No servers to run, no infrastructure to manage.

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Deploy your StaticMCP files to any static host
netlify deploy --dir ./your-staticmcp-output

# 2. Connect AI clients to the hosted bridge
https://bridge.staticmcp.com/sse?url=https://your-site.netlify.app
```

### Usage Examples

**With MCP Inspector (Testing):**
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  "https://bridge.staticmcp.com/sse?url=https://your-site.com"
```

**With Claude Desktop:**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "my-docs": {
        "command": "curl",
        "args": [
          "-X", "POST",
          "https://bridge.staticmcp.com/sse?url=https://your-site.com"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### When to Use Hosted Bridge
- âœ… **Quick prototyping** - Get started in minutes

### When to Self-Host
- ðŸ”§ **Custom extensions** - Need runtime extensions not in hosted version
- ðŸ”§ **Enterprise requirements** - Custom SLAs or compliance needs
- ðŸ”§ **High volume** - Beyond free tier limits
- ðŸ”§ **Network restrictions** - Must route through private networks

## Architecture Role

![](@site/static/img/arch.png)

The bridge serves as the interface between two worlds:

- **MCP Protocol Side**: Handles standard MCP requests from AI models and applications via JSON-RPC over stdio, HTTP, or SSE
- **Static File Side**: Translates requests into appropriate file paths and HTTP requests

This separation allows StaticMCP to leverage the full power of modern web infrastructure while maintaining complete compatibility with existing MCP tooling.

## Transport Support

StaticMCP bridges can implement any of the standard MCP transport mechanisms:

### JSON-RPC over Stdio
Traditional command-line bridges that communicate via standard input/output:
- Ideal for development tools and local testing
- Compatible with MCP Inspector and development environments  
- Simple process-based isolation and debugging

### HTTP Transport
RESTful bridges that expose MCP operations as HTTP endpoints:
- Native web integration for browser-based clients
- Standard HTTP status codes and headers
- Easy integration with existing web infrastructure
- Support for CORS and web security policies

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
Real-time bridges using SSE for bi-directional communication:
- Efficient for long-running connections
- Built-in reconnection and error handling
- Ideal for web applications requiring live updates
- Lower latency than traditional HTTP polling

## Core Responsibilities

### Protocol Translation

The bridge's primary function is converting MCP operations into file system requests:

- **Resource Requests**: Map `resources/read` calls to specific JSON files in the `resources/` directory
- **Tool Calls**: Transform `tools/call` requests into lookups in the `tools/` hierarchy
- **Capability Discovery**: Serve manifest information from the root `mcp.json` file

### Request Routing

Bridges implement intelligent routing logic to map complex requests to static files:

```
MCP Request: resources/read { uri: "file://README.md" }
â†“
File Path: resources/README.md.json
â†“
HTTP Request: GET https://cdn.example.com/resources/README.md.json
```

### Error Handling

Professional error handling ensures graceful degradation:

- **File Not Found**: Convert 404 errors into appropriate MCP error responses
- **Network Issues**: Handle connectivity problems with service unavailable errors
- **Invalid Content**: Validate JSON responses and handle parsing errors

### Caching Integration

Bridges can implement sophisticated caching strategies:

- **Local Caching**: Store frequently accessed files in memory or local storage
- **HTTP Caching**: Respect and leverage standard HTTP cache headers
- **CDN Integration**: Work seamlessly with content delivery networks

## Implementation Approaches

### Standalone Servers

Independent bridge applications that run as separate processes:

- **Stdio Bridges**: Accept MCP requests via standard input/output for command-line tools
- **Streamable HTTP Servers**: Provide single-endpoint HTTP bridges for modern web clients
- **Legacy HTTP+SSE Servers**: Support deprecated dual-endpoint pattern for backward compatibility
- Handle requests to static file hosts
- Suitable for development and testing environments
- Can be written in any programming language

### Embedded Libraries

Bridge functionality integrated directly into MCP client applications:

- Eliminate network overhead between client and bridge
- Enable advanced caching and optimization strategies
- Provide tighter integration with application logic
- Ideal for production deployments

### Serverless Functions

Cloud-hosted bridges deployed as serverless functions:

- Automatically scale with demand
- Integrate with cloud storage and CDN services
- Provide geographic distribution for global applications
- Reduce operational overhead

### Proxy Services

Bridge services that sit between multiple clients and static hosts:

- Share cached content across multiple MCP clients
- Implement advanced rate limiting and authentication
- Provide monitoring and analytics capabilities
- Support multi-tenant scenarios

## Configuration Options

### Source Location

Bridges support multiple source types for maximum flexibility:

- **Local File System**: Direct access to local directories for development
- **HTTP/HTTPS URLs**: Remote static hosting for production deployments
- **Cloud Storage**: Integration with AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.
- **CDN Endpoints**: Direct connection to content delivery networks

### Performance Tuning

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for improved performance
- **Concurrent Requests**: Handle multiple simultaneous requests efficiently
- **Timeout Configuration**: Appropriate timeouts for different network conditions
- **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry strategies for transient failures

### Security Features

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure secure communication with static hosts
- **Access Control**: Implement authentication and authorization where needed
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize requests to prevent security vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse and ensure fair resource usage

## Bridge Deployment Options

| Feature | Hosted Bridge | Self-Hosted SSE | Self-Hosted STDIO |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Time** | Instant | 30 minutes | 10 minutes |
| **Maintenance** | Zero | Medium | Low |
| **Custom Extensions** | Built-in only | Full support | Full support |
| **Global Performance** | Excellent | Depends on deployment | Local only |
| **Cost** | Free (with limits) | Infrastructure cost | Device power |
| **Use Case** | Production, prototyping | Enterprise, custom needs | Development, testing |

**Recommendation**: Start with the hosted bridge, then self-host if you need custom extensions or have more powerful demands.

## Types

### STDIO

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector staticmcp_stdio_bridge ./my-static-mcp/
```

Checkout [`stdio_bridge`](https://github.com/StaticMCP/stdio_bridge) for more details

### Fixed SSE

On the hosting server, start the SSE server to host the StaticMCP files (which partially looses the benefit of it being static).

```bash
staticmcp_sse_fixed ./my-static-mcp/
staticmcp_sse_fixed https://staticmcp.com/mcp/
```

Checkout [`staticmcp_sse_bridge`](https://github.com/StaticMCP/sse_bridge) for more details.

### Dynamic SSE

Use a dynamicÂ SSE bridge that takes in the url to the StaticMCP files as param.

`https://bridge.staticmcp.com/sse?url=https://staticmcp.com/mcp/`

Checkout [`staticmcp_sse_bridge`](https://github.com/StaticMCP/sse_bridge) for more details.

## Standard Compliance

StaticMCP bridges maintain strict compatibility with MCP specifications across all transport methods:

- **Protocol Versions**: Support for current MCP protocol versions
- **Transport Flexibility**: JSON-RPC over stdio, Streamable HTTP, or legacy HTTP+SSE transports  
- **Message Format**: Full compliance with MCP message schemas
- **Error Codes**: Standard MCP error codes and message formats
- **Response Format**: Exact adherence to MCP response schemas

This ensures that any MCP client can work with StaticMCP without modification, regardless of the chosen transport mechanism.

## Extensions
